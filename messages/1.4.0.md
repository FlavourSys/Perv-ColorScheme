Perv Color Schemes v1.4.0 Changelog:

> **This version is deprecated! The new version, rewritten from scratch, is available at [Color Scheme - Perv](https://github.com/micck/perv-colorscheme). This version is kept in the last state, as the new one does look a bit different. Also, if you have Sublime Text with a version <=3149, please keep this version.**

- _major change:_ complete overhaul of the `Markdown (&amp; GFM)` syntax highlighting.  I added support for [Markdown Editing][12] including: background colour for inline code, fenced code and block quotes; striped a lot of colours (e. g. all header texts and link texts are white now); added support for ~~strike-through~~ (as there is no underline or strike-through font style in [Sublime Text][51]--it is a text editor and not a text processor after all :expressionless:--a reddish background colour was used).  Overall `Markdown` should now be easier to write and read.
- _major change:_ added support for [BBCode][30] syntax highlighting
- _major change:_ added basic support for [Bracket Highlighter][29]
- _change:_ the colouring of parenthesis in  `JSON`, `XML` and `HTML` files was changed to reflect the tag/name for easier readability
- _changed:_ the selection background colouring (to make it better readable in all different syntax scopes)
- _changed:_ the line highlighting colour, to make the icons in the Gutter used by different packages ([Bracket Highlighter][29], [Git Gutter][22], [Color Highlighter][32], etc.) better visible--additionally that also solved the problem with the `"highlight_line": true,` setting
- _change:_ merged [Git Gutter][22] additions from @jisaacks
- _change:_ merged `ERB` additions from @Kaboofa
- _minor change:_ in order to decrease the size of the package, I moved the screenshots to a different location.
