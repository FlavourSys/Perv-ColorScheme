Perv Color Schemes v1.3 Changelog:

+ major change: added new Orange color scheme: **"Moonlight"**
+ major change: added support for **"CSS"**, &amp; **"SASS/SCSS"** (through the packages [Syntax Highlighting for Sass](https://github.com/P233/Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass) and [Sass](https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle))
+ major change: added support for **"Markdown"** (Standard Sublime Text syntax highlighter) and **"GitHub Flavored Markdown"** through the package [knockdown](https://github.com/aziz/knockdown) (which also adds more highlighting for the standard Markdown syntax to any Markdown files)
+ major change: added support for **"reStructuredText"** (Standard Sublime Text syntax highlighter) and updated coloring for [reStructuredTextExtended](https://github.com/jhaubrich/Jesse-s-Sublime-Mods)
+ major change: changed highlighting for (**"Git"**)**"DIFF"** output/files, added support for **"GitGutter"**
+ major change: regarding "line highlighting": it is nearly impossible to have one color which works with `highlight_line` turned on or off.  And as I don't use that, I added a second in the tmTheme file for those who do use `highlight_line`. See above for a short description how to change the "line highlight" color
+ change: removed *italics* from "function arguments", but they are still rendered in color
+ change: updated Ruby embedded source code highlighting
+ change: updated JSON highlighting
+ change: integrated YAML highlighting
+ minor change: updated the SublimeLinter colors
+ minor change: adjusted the bracket (underline) colors to fit the "Orange" scheme
